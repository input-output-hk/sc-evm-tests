# Sidechain EVM Tests
​
## 1. Notice
​
As of 2023, IOG will no longer be updating or maintaining this repo.
​  
After three months of experimentation with the proof-of-concept EVM sidechain testnet, we have gathered valuable learnings from this experience and this innovative playground. New use cases and functionality were tested, feedback from the community was gathered, and we are now shifting our focus back to the strategic evolution of our sidechains approach.
​  
All information included below is considered publicly available and is free to be leveraged by developers to fork it to build and experiment with their own EVM sidechain solution. Should you have any questions, please reach out to our team on our IOG Discord server.
​
## 2. Description
